### Using oxford\_iiiit pet dataset to train some neural networks
Originally, this dataset is used by tensorflow documentation to implement an example model of image semantic segmentation.  
However, recently, using a fish dataset, I learned how to create image classification models.

Thus, I decided to apply what I knew to this dataset.
